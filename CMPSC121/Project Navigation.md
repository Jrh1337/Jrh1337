# ---------TABLE OF CONTENTS----------
-Hyperlinks take you to .cpp with solution I came up with.

## ---Activities--- Designed as homework assignments to build proficiency.

## [Activity 2](./Coding%20Projects/Activity%202.cpp)
- Write an algorithm to read in three numbers from the user. Then, add the first two  numbers and divide the result by the third one.

## [Activity 3]
- Write a program that will ask the user to enter 5 integers, read them in and display their average. Average should be a double. A typical run might look similar to the following:

Enter 5 integers: 3 8 9 6 7  The average is 6.6

## [Activity 4]
- Write a program which reads in five temperature values in Fahrenheit and displays them in Celsius. Organize your results in a table, similar to the one shown below. Make sure to set the appropriate precision and try to match the table alignment shown in the output sample. You can find the appropriate formula on the web.  Hint: Integer division does NOT give accurate answers!

## [Activity 5]
- Modify the problem so that the program asks for the number of shares purchased, the purchase price, the commission percent, and the sell price. You can assume that he sold all the shares and that the buy and sell commissions are the same.
