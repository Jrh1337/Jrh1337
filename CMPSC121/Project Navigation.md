# ---------TABLE OF CONTENTS----------
-Hyperlinks take you to .cpp with solution I came up with.

## ---Activities--- Designed as homework assignments to build proficiency.

## [Activity 2](./Coding%20Projects/Activity%202.cpp)
- Write an algorithm to read in three numbers from the user. Then, add the first two  numbers and divide the result by the third one.

## [Activity 3]
- Write a program that will ask the user to enter 5 integers, read them in and display their average. Average should be a double. A typical run might look similar to the following:

Enter 5 integers: 3 8 9 6 7  The average is 6.6

## [Activity 4]
- Write a program which reads in five temperature values in Fahrenheit and displays them in Celsius. Organize your results in a table, similar to the one shown below. Make sure to set the appropriate precision and try to match the table alignment shown in the output sample. You can find the appropriate formula on the web.  Hint: Integer division does NOT give accurate answers!

## [Activity 5]
- Modify the problem so that the program asks for the number of shares purchased, the purchase price, the commission percent, and the sell price. You can assume that he sold all the shares and that the buy and sell commissions are the same.

## [Activity 24](./Project%20Navigation.md#activity-24)
Write a program using parallel vectors and a function which fills each of them with 500 random numbers between 1 and 100. The program should then pass both vectors to a function which will return an integer indicating a count of how many times both vectors had even numbers in the same location. So if vector01[0] contained 4 and vector02[0] contained 12, you would add one to count. If vector01[1] contained 3 and vector02[1] contained 4, you would not add one to count.

main would display something like:

The Vectors contain 128 cells where both values are even.

Note: create a much smaller vector (20 numbers perhaps) to test your program on. This way you can test your program correctness much easier.

## [Activity 25](./Project%20Navigation.md#activity-25)
Write a program to fill a vector with 5000 random numbers. Then display:

- The smallest number
- The largest number
- The number of odd values
- The number of even values
- The total of the values
- The average of the values
- Ask the user for an integer and display the subscript of the cell where it was found or NOT FOUND! if it isn’t found. Use a binary search to do this.

There is a file called "Activity 25 Sort functions.zip" under Materials in this week’s module. Download and unzip the shellSort and swapper function Download Download and unzip the shellSort and swapper function. Since you will be using a binary search, the vector will have to be in order. We will discuss sorting more in the next module, but you can use the provided code to perform the sort.

Each of the preceding values should be determined by a function and returned to main where they should be displayed.
