# Week 11 Least Squares Approximation, QR factorization and Diagonalizable Matrices

## - Introduction to Least Squares Approximation

Consider the three points $(1,0), (2,1)$ and $(3,3)$ Setup and solve a linear system of equations $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ Determine if there is a line 
$y=mx+b$ that passes through all data points.

$(1,0)$: $y=0,x=1$ so, $0=1m+b$

$(2,1)$: $1=2m+b$

$(3,3)$: $3=3m+b$

Put into an augmented matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\ 3 & 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

Reduce to RREF:

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\\ 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$$

This is an inconsistent system with no solution.  Meaning no line passes through all three of these points.

Now find an $\vec{x}$ that makes $A\vec{x}$ as close as possible to $\vec{b}$
